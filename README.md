# Statistical Project: Comparing MLE and MOM for COVID-19 Vaccine Efficacy

## Overview

This project, titled **"Comparing Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) and Method of Moments (MOM) for COVID-19 Vaccine Efficacy,"** explores the statistical methodologies used to evaluate the efficacy of Pfizer-BioNTech's BNT162b2 vaccine. The analysis provides insights into how these statistical techniques differ and their respective applications in real-world scenarios.

## Objectives

- **Primary Goal**: To compare the effectiveness of two statistical methods—MLE and MOM—in evaluating vaccine efficacy.
- **Key Deliverables**:
  1. Quantify vaccine efficacy based on symptomatic COVID-19 cases.
  2. Calculate confidence intervals and hypothesis tests for both methods.
  3. Assess which method provides more robust and reliable results.

## Methods

1. **Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE)**:
   - Formulated the likelihood function for vaccine efficacy.
   - Maximized the function to estimate efficacy and confidence intervals.

2. **Method of Moments (MOM)**:
   - Derived estimates by equating sample moments to theoretical moments.
   - Compared the estimates and uncertainty measures with MLE.

3. **Statistical Analysis**:
   - Conducted hypothesis tests to determine statistical significance.
   - Visualized and compared the results of the two methods.

## Key Findings

- **Vaccine Efficacy**:
  - Both methods confirmed high efficacy of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine in preventing symptomatic COVID-19.
- **Comparison**:
  - MLE provided narrower confidence intervals and greater precision in estimation.
  - MOM offered simplicity but at the cost of slightly less robust results.
